## My Programming Background

I really enjoy learning and working with R and R Studio. So far it has
been a pretty straightforward language to learn and apply. My only
comparison thus far is Python. There are some similarities and some
differences, but knowing one certainly helps understand the other
better. In particular, I enjoy the object oriented aspects of the
language. I miss using loops more as it sounds like that is not a
functionality R is designed for. I do not consider R a difficult
language to learn.
