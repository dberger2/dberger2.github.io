 test Greetings!  My name is Dave and I'm enrolled in the Online NCSU Applied Statistics and Data Science Certificate program.

I live in Charlotte NC with my family, dog, and two guninea pigs.

# More Information 

In our free time, we certainly enjoy getting out and seeing what North Carolina has to offer!

## The beach!

I can think of better places to be than at the beach!

Enjoying time to visit some of the parks and see the views in the appalachains!

## Local things to do in Charlotte

Very much looking forward to enjoying some of the amenities Charlotte has once the pandemic subsides such as the US National White Water Center!
